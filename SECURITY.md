## Send security issues to: [Security Advisory Form](https://github.com/notvolks/SulfurAI-DRL-001-03-54c/security/advisories/new)

## Include:
### _What version/branch(-s/-es) the issue is in._

## We will attempt to release a fix as fast as we can, but please do not publicly disclose of the issue until we have told you it is fixed or after 90 days.

## Security Notes:
 - Always use latest stable version.
 - Check for known issues.
 - Keep your dependancies up to date/ at the version they are listed to be at.
 - Read the CompatibleVersions folder to see how backwards compatible it is.
 - Do NOT use un-authorised forks if a version does not support backwards-compatibility with yours. They are not supported for a REASON.
