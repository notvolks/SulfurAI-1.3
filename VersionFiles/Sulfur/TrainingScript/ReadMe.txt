To start creating training data for sulfur automatically, go into the build folder and run the python script labelled "trainer.bat".
It will run indefinitely as long as it is open.
It will replace your *current* input.txt file so please make sure it does not contain important information.

NOTE:
-This not only generates training data, it also generates userbase patterns so do note this!
