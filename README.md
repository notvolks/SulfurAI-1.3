## WARNING:
> ### _This model is WORK IN PROGRESS, please report any NON-SECURITY issues to the said issues tab._


## What is SulfurAI?

> _SulfurAI is a Local Analytical Model that anylyses text input to find user preference & info from a small dataset , designed to run in the background of an application or website._

## How do i use SulfurAI?

> First, add your input to data/input.txt
> ,Then run :
 `Run SulfurAI.bat`

> _Note: there is a 50 character limit and special characters will be removed._

## How is Sulfur trained?

> _The current model uses the sulfax architecture, splitting data across 2 sets and further dividing the data with an 80/20 ratio._
```
Data is labelled with 3 parameters:
 <input,accuracy,predicted device>

 This provides the model with a minimum 50% accuracy, which is planned to be scaled to 70% by 2026.
```
## SulfurAI's purpose.

> _To find the preferences of a user base and average ratios efficiently, providing companies or regular users with insights on how to improve reach._


## Dependancies:
```
-Python with version 3.13 // *Warning: Later releases WILL require Python 3.11 ONLY*
We cannot ensure Sulfur will run if it is not the correct version.

-Python Libraries:
 Although Sulfur attempts to install all libraries, the following list is incase any fail and must be installed manually:

  --Python NLTK--
  Provides word & sentiment analysis.

  --Python TensorFlow--
  Provides Neural Networking.

  --Python TQDM--
  Provides Loading GUI.

  --Python PyTorch (Although not used.)--
  Will provide ML and CUDA integration.

  --Python Pygame--
  Provides easy GUI.

  --Python Sklearn--
  Provides machine learning processes.

  --Python LanguageToolPython--
  Analyses Language for NLTK.

  --Python Langdetect--
  Assists LanguageTool.

  --Python Numpy--
  Handles datasets efficiently.

  --Python Transformers--
  Provides GenAI and ML solutions.





-CUDA-
While not necessary as of this version, Nvidia CUDA support will be needed for later releases.
```
## Thats all. Enjoy!
