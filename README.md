## WARNING:
> ### _This model is WORK IN PROGRESS, please report any NON-SECURITY issues to the said issues tab._


## ❓ What is SulfurAI ❓

> _SulfurAI is a Local Analytical Model that anylyses text input to find user preference & info from a small dataset , designed to run in the background of an application or website._

## 🤔 How do i use SulfurAI 🤔


  
### _----------------------------Simple python running----------------------------_

<div align="left">
  
> First, add your input to DATA/input.txt
>, then open the file:
> 
 `Run SulfurAI.bat`

> **Note:** There is a character limit, and special characters will be removed. You can change these settings in the configuration.

### _------------------------------------------------------- Using the API ------------------------------------------------------_

<div align="left">
  


### _🐍 Python: Local 🐍_

1. **Create a new script** in the root SulfurAI folder. This will be your initialization script.

2. Add the following lines of code:

    ```python
    import SulfurAI
    SulfurAI.setup_local()
    ```

3. Run the script and then add any code from the documentation as a return.

4. You can create your own script or use an existing one in any directory, importing this initialization script with your required returns.

## 🔨 How is Sulfur trained 🔨 

> _The current model uses the sulfax architecture, splitting data across 4 sets and further dividing the data with an 80/20 [labelled/un-labelled] ratio._
```
Data is labelled with 3 parameters:
 <input,accuracy,predicted device>

 This provides the model with a minimum 50% accuracy, which is planned to be scaled to 70% by 2026.
```
## SulfurAI's purpose.

> _To find the preferences of a user base and average ratios efficiently, providing companies or regular users with insights on how to improve reach and retention._


## Dependancies:
```
-Python with version 3.11-
We cannot ensure Sulfur will run if it is not the correct version.
