## ❓ What is SulfurAI ❓

> _SulfurAI is a Local Analytical Model that analyses text input to find user preference & info from a small dataset , designed to run in the background of an application or website._

## 🤔 How do i use SulfurAI 🤔

> First, add your input to DATA/input.txt
>, then open the file:
> 
 `Run SulfurAI.bat`

> _Note: there is a character limit and special characters will be removed. Change this in the settings._

## 🔨 How is Sulfur trained 🔨 

> _The current model uses the sulfax architecture, splitting data across 4 sets and further dividing the data with an 80/20 [labelled/un-labelled] ratio._
```
Data is labelled with 3 parameters:
 <input,accuracy,predicted device>

 This provides the model with a minimum 50% accuracy, which is planned to be scaled to 70% by 2026.
```
## SulfurAI's purpose.

> _To find the preferences of a user base and average ratios efficiently, providing companies or regular users with insights on how to improve reach and retention._


## Dependancies:
```
-Python with version 3.13 // *Warning: Later releases WILL require Python 3.11 ONLY*
We cannot ensure Sulfur will run if it is not the correct version.

-Python Libraries:
 Although Sulfur attempts to install all libraries, the following list is incase any fail and must be installed manually:

  --Python NLTK--
  Provides word & sentiment analysis.

  --Python TensorFlow--
  Provides Neural Networking.

  --Python TQDM--
  Provides Loading GUI.

  --Python PyTorch (Although not used.)--
  Will provide ML and CUDA integration.

  --Python Pygame--
  Provides easy GUI.

  --Python Sklearn--
  Provides machine learning processes.

  --Python LanguageToolPython--
  Analyses Language for NLTK.

  --Python Langdetect--
  Assists LanguageTool.

  --Python Numpy--
  Handles datasets efficiently.

  --Python Transformers--
  Provides GenAI and ML solutions.





-CUDA-
While not necessary as of this version, Nvidia CUDA support will be needed for later releases.
```
We are committed to making open source an enjoyable and respectful experience for our community. See <a href="https://github.com/notvolks/SulfurAI-1.3/blob/7659173774ff6fc09db1a1a957fa08d0f45bfea8/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"><code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT</code></a> for more information.


## 💬 Other FAQ 💬

---

> _Do I need to restart my system after Sulfur installs?_
> 
> _Answer: No, sulfur does *not* require a system restart after installation, although it may require a manual restart._

---

> _Does Sulfur encrypt my cache/training data?_
> 
> _Answer: No, Sulfur does *not* encrypt cache/training_data as it is designed to run locally. Server support and encryption will be available on the business version._

---

> _Can I create my own model with Sulfur?_
> 
> _Answer: Yes, you can modify every Sulfur script to make your own model, full support for this will come in later updates with user friendly UI._


---

> _I am getting a "path too long" error while extracting, how to fix?_
> 
> _Answer: This means you are extracting Sulfur as a Zip file. Windows has a 100 path limit on zip files so you should either convert the file to .7z or download the provided .7z versions from the releases tab._
